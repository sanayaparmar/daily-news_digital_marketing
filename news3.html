<b><h1>Countries commit to action at UN General Assembly Ministerial meeting</h1></b>

<p>New York, 22 September 2022 (WMO) - Momentum is gathering to achieve a plan to ensure that every person on Earth is protected by an early warning system in the next five years, thus grabbing one of the most effective  “low hanging fruits” of climate change adaptation.    

Ministers gathered in New York on 21 September during the 77th United Nations General Assembly High-Level week to show support for the UN Early Warnings for All initiative spearheaded by WMO as an urgent climate adaptation measure. Canada and France both made big new financial commitments to helping vulnerable countries and communities become more resilient to extreme weather and climate change impacts.

In his speech to the General Assembly, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced CAN$ 10 million in funding over four years for the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems initiative (CREWS) "to improve emergency preparedness in developing countries, particularly the small island developing states."  Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, Minister for State for Development, Francophonie and International Partnerships of France told the ministerial event that her government would double its annual contribution to CREWS, starting in 2023, to 8 million Euros per year.</p>

Organized by the United Nations, Government of Egypt, and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the ministerial Early Warnings for Climate Adaptation Event brought together countries from around the world, donors, international development agencies and the private sector. The event was hosted by the Permanent Mission of Finland to the United Nations in New York.

<p>“We must make sure that every person, community and nation has access to effective early warning systems within the next five years,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told the opening session of the UN General Assembly on 20 September. “It is high time to move beyond endless discussions.  Vulnerable countries need meaningful action, “ he said.

Mr Guterres has requested the WMO to present a roadmap to the UN Climate Change conference, COP27, in Egypt in November to achieve the life-saving campaign. COP27 will move the focus from promises and pledges to action on the ground.

“One out of three persons globally, primarily in Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries, and six out of every ten persons in Africa lack access to effective early warning systems. This is why the Secretary-General has called for a global plan to ensure universal coverage of Early Warning Systems within the next five years. We have the technological tools and financial resources to get this done. Protecting the lives and safeguarding the livelihoods of those on the frontlines of the climate crisis must be a collective global responsibility, “ said Assistant Secretary-General for Climate Action, Selwin Hart.</p>
