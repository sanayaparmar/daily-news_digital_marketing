    <p>Executives today face a mandate to navigate rising complexity, scale emerging solutions, and build trust in a world where the lines between digital and physical and centralized and decentralized continue to blur. The insights in this report can help business leaders decide which of these frontier technologies are most relevant to their companies by demonstrating how others are starting to apply them today. These findings emerge from our analysis of quantitative measures of interest, innovation, equity investment, and talent that underpin each of the 13 trends and explore the underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions around them. (For more about our research, please see the sidebar, “Research methodology.”)</p>
    <p>In 2025, we see a continuation of the trends that have been shaping the technology landscape in recent years, with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI), application-specific semiconductors, and quantum technologies. These trends are not only driving innovation but also reshaping industries and creating new opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>This outlook highlights transformative trends that are driving innovation and addressing critical challenges across sectors. Artificial intelligence stands out not only as a powerful technology wave on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of the other trends. Its impact increasingly occurs via a combination with other trends, as AI both accelerates progress within individual domains and unlocks new possibilities at the intersections—accelerating the training of robots, advancing scientific discoveries in bioengineering, optimizing energy systems, and much more. The evolution of AI solutions in the marketplace increasingly combines aspects of trends we previously analyzed separately as applied AI and generative AI, so this year, they are examined together.</p>

<p>Even as excitement about AI applications and their use cases builds, realizing AI’s full potential across sectors will require continued innovations to manage computing intensity, reduce deployment costs, and drive infrastructure investment. This will also demand thoughtful approaches to safety, governance, and workforce adaptation, creating a wide range of opportunities for industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike.

<h1>New and notable</h1>
<p>In addition to the growing reach of AI, another new trend we have chosen to highlight in this year’s report is agentic AI, which has rapidly emerged as a major focus of interest and experimentation in enterprise and consumer technology. Agentic AI combines the flexibility and generality of AI foundation models with the ability to act in the world by creating “virtual coworkers” that can autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Although quantitative measures of interest and equity investment levels are as yet relatively low compared with more established trends, agentic AI is among the fastest growing of this year’s trends, signaling its potentially revolutionary possibilities.
</p>
<p>We also highlight the trend of AI-powered chips, which are designed to handle the specific

AI is also the primary catalyst for another trend we highlight this year: application-specific semiconductors. While Moore’s Law and the semiconductor layer of the technology stack have long been key enablers of other tech trends, innovations in semiconductors have spiked as reflected in quantitative metrics such as number of patents. These innovations have come in response to exponentially higher demands for computing capacity, memory, and networking for AI training and inference, as well as a need to manage cost, heat, and electric power consumption. This has given rise to a slew of new products, new competitors, and new ecosystems.
</p>
<p>Technology trends also have a variety of profiles along the dimensions we analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, general-purpose technology with use cases in every industry and business function—and thus lots of innovation and interest—and it is scaling rapidly across the business landscape. Quantum technologies have a different profile. Quantum computing has the potential for transformative impact in certain critical domains, such as cryptography and material science, and the basic technology continues to be developed. Recent announcements, particularly by technology giants, have sparked increased interest, but real-world business impact will require even more technology advancements to make quantum computing practical. Other trends and subtrends vary across the multiple dimensions we analyzed, offering different approaches—from watchful waiting to aggressive deployment—to business leaders depending on their industries and competitive positions.</p>
